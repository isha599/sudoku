# sudoku
sudoku using backtracking algorithm ,the program will display a 9X9 sudoku board and then display the solved sudoku.
In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.
in this we are going to make a 9X9 grid sudoku using backtracking algorithm.
in this the sudoku grid or the puzzle is inputed at the compile time and it can be seen on the console then the program will ask for the solution to display if the user input yes then it will print the solved sudoku and if user input no then a thankyou message willbe displayed on the screen.
Functions used in Sudoku.cpp are as follows.
